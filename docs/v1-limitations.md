# V1 Limitations

- Mini-games share simplified UI controls (buttons, grid taps) instead of bespoke animations; timing fidelity compared to HTML prototypes is approximated with seeded delays rather than replicated precisely.
- Go/No-Go and other inhibition-heavy tasks rely on explicit button choices instead of allowing truly withheld responses; omission tracking is simulated via selections.
- Tutorial practice hooks are descriptive only because the current GameRunner does not execute demo configs.
