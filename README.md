# Plasticity Prototype

This repo is a starter skeleton for the Plasticity prototype.

It includes:
- HTML mini-game shells in `plasticity-games/games/`
- A shared helper stub in `plasticity-games/shared/plasticityGame.js`
- A basic test harness in `plasticity-games/test/index.html`
- Supabase backend glue in `src/backend/`
- Frontend message listener glue in `src/frontend/`
- A placeholder Supabase schema file in `supabase/schema.sql`

You will use GPT Codex (or similar) to progressively fill out the game logic and backend helpers using the prompts you've generated.
